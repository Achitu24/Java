## Carpet Cost Java
Design, implement and test a Java application program that calculates and prints the floor area of an apartment, and a breakdown of the costs and the total cost to install carpet in an apartment. We assume that the size of an apartment is a rectangle with dimensions given as its length and width. The cost of installing carpet is made up from a cost related to the area of the apartment, plus a labour service charge cost. The cost related to the floor area is £4.75 per square metre. The labour service charge is a fixed amount of £16.50, plus one fourth of the floor area. However, if the area of the apartment is strictly larger than 100m2 , an extra 10% is added to the labour charge (the total labour charge, including the fixed £16.50 labour charge). On top of the total installation cost, VAT is calculated as 20% of the total cost of the carpet installation. We should calculate (and print) the floor area the floor area cost, the labour service charge, the total cost before VAT, the VAT, and the total cost. The user of the program will input the length and width of the aparment.
